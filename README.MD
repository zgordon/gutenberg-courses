# WordPress Gutenberg Block Editor UI Assets for Sketch

Used for [https://gutenberg.courses/](https://gutenberg.courses/) site listing courses on how to use and build with blocks in WordPress.

Feel free to use these assets if you like, I just ask that you do not use the exacts with the *exact* same design and text as the examples below since those are marketing graphics specifically for our courses.

However, go crazy with the assets and I'd be happy to merge PRs with any improvements folks make :)

The intention behind the style is not to give a completely accurate representation of the block editor, rather just enough to make it obvious or familiar.

CREDIT: All the custom icons come from the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/apps/) I suggest the desktop app and an account if you're into that sort of thing.
