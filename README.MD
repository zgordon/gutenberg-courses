# WordPress Gutenberg Block Editor UI Assets

Used for [https://gutenberg.courses/](https://gutenberg.courses/) site listing courses on how to use and build with blocks in WordPress.

Feel free to use these assets if you like, I just ask you do a PR with any improvements you might make.

This is not intentened to be a completely accurate representation of the block editor, just enough to make it obvious (hopefully).
