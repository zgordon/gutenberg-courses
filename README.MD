# WordPress Gutenberg Block Editor UI Assets

Used for [https://gutenberg.courses/](https://gutenberg.courses/) site listing courses on how to use and build with blocks in WordPress.

Feel free to use these assets if you like, I just ask that you do not use them exactly how they are used in the examples below since thats marketing specifically for our courses.

However, go crazy with the assets and I'd be happy to accept PRs with any improvements folks make :)

The intention behind the style is not to give a completely accurate representation of the block editor, rather just enough to make it obvious or familiar.
